# Go-NUNC

Go-NUNC is a change point detection package using the NUNC algorithm (developed by Edward Austin et al). NUNC takes a feed of data and determines points that do not fit the distribution of presented by earlier data points.

To demonstrate how `go-nunc` can be used, see the ping tool [example](./cmd/ping/) that runs a fast ping, signifying if any distribution changes occur.
